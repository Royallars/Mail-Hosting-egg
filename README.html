Mailcow Email Hosting on Pterodactyl

This guide will walk you through setting up a Mailcow email server using a custom Pterodactyl egg. The Mailcow server will be containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and manage email services.

1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:
	•	Pterodactyl Panel and Wings installed and configured.
	•	A server with at least 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs, and 20GB disk for Mailcow.
	•	Docker and Docker Compose installed on the host machine (required for Mailcow).
	•	A registered domain with the ability to configure DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM).

2. Pterodactyl Egg Installation

Import the Custom Egg
	1.	Go to your Pterodactyl Admin Panel.
	2.	Navigate to Nests -> Import Egg.
	3.	Upload the provided egg file to import the Mailcow egg.

File Contents
	•	After importing, the egg will create the necessary configurations for Mailcow, including a docker-compose.yml file and a startup command.

3. Creating the Server
	1.	After importing the egg, navigate to Servers in the Pterodactyl Panel and create a new server.
	2.	Choose the Mailcow Email Hosting egg.
	3.	Assign the required resources:
	•	CPU: 2 vCPUs minimum.
	•	RAM: 4GB or more recommended.
	•	Disk Space: 20GB minimum for the Mailcow setup.
	4.	Start the server.

4. Configuring Mailcow

Once the server starts, you’ll need to configure Mailcow:
	1.	Access the server console through Pterodactyl.
	2.	Navigate to the Mailcow directory.
	3.	Copy the example configuration to generate a new configuration file.
	4.	Edit the configuration file to set your hostname, domain, and other options.
	5.	Permissions:
Ensure proper permissions for the configuration.
	6.	Start Mailcow using Docker Compose.

5. Post-Setup

After Mailcow has started, follow these steps:
	1.	DNS Configuration:
	•	Configure MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your domain. You can do this via your domain registrar’s DNS management panel.
	2.	Access the Mailcow Web Interface:
	•	Open the Mailcow web interface at http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>.
	•	You should see the Mailcow setup page.
	3.	SSL Setup (Optional):
	•	Set up Let’s Encrypt for SSL certificates for secure email communication.
	4.	Email Account Setup:
	•	Create email accounts through the Mailcow admin interface.

6. Troubleshooting
	•	Docker Not Starting:
	•	Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed on the host system. Run docker --version and docker-compose --version to verify.
	•	Firewall Issues:
	•	Ensure the firewall on your server allows incoming ports for Mailcow (e.g., ports 25, 443, 587).
	•	SSL Issues:
	•	If you have SSL errors, check your domain’s DNS settings and ensure your certificates are properly set up.
